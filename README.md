# protractor-demo
Demonstration using Protractor for e2e testing with Cucumber

The project uses Protractor with Cucumber to run e2e tests.
(Look at `package.json` for references on the `npm` scripts that can be run)

## Execute tests
- Clone repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run webdriver-update` (only the first time)
- Run `npm run webdriver-start`
- On another terminal in the same directory, run `npm run e2e`
